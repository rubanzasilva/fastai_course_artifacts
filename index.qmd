### Overview

We'll cover:

1. **Theory** - The mathematical foundations and concepts
2. **Implementation** - Building Stable Diffusion from scratch using PyTorch
3. **Practical Applications** - Real-world usage and experimentation

Based on the excellent [fast.ai Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) course.
